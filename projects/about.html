          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            My journey in web and software development is still in its early
            stages, but my passion for this field is undeniable. As an
            undergraduate student, I am driven by a strong desire for knowledge
            and a constant urge to create innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am diligently honing my skills in the core programming
            languages that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This solid
            foundation allows me to build user-friendly and visually appealing
            user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I am actively exploring back-end development concepts
            to gain a comprehensive understanding of web application
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technical expertise, I value critical thinking and
            introspection. This analytical approach helps me tackle problems
            creatively and develop efficient solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and actively seek
            connections with like-minded individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This portfolio serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous
            learning and professional development.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exploring my projects, you can gain insights into my current
            skillset and the direction I envision for my future endeavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am eager to leverage my abilities and collaborate on projects that
            push the boundaries of what is possible in the ever-evolving realm
            of web development.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            My academic journey has provided me with the foundation upon which I
            am building my web and software development expertise. Currently, I
            am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Software Development at
            Brigham Young University, Idaho through BYU Pathway Worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            This program has instilled in me a strong understanding of
            programming fundamentals and problem-solving methodologies. In
            addition to my formal education, I am a dedicated self-learner who
            actively seeks out opportunities to expand my knowledge. I regularly
            participate in online courses, tutorials, and workshops to stay
            up-to-date with the latest advancements in web development
            technologies.
